## Process and Thought logic

User Stories:
* Creating a user story help me focus on who was my intended audience and what my basic goals were for the project.
  * Game was created for a single player with specific MVP goals:

Wire Frame: 
* First step was creating wire frame.
  * The wireframe process started with creating the first real concrete visual process for the project and how I wanted page layout to appear.
    Within the drawing you can see the various stages of user interaction within the game. Taking this visual guide I was able to start creating
    a foundation using HTML and CSS.

### Technologies used to create Project
#

1. HTML
   * Semantic HTML
1. CSS
   * CSS styling and layout
   * CSS Grid
1. JavaScript
   * JavaScript programming
   * Working with the DOM
   * JavaScript events



#
## Creating the Layout and Design:

* The structure of the gameboard was created using HTML And CSS, Using this method allowed me to create a grid to display all the images on the screen.

* I created a number of divs that contained an image in each div. The divs where placed inside a game-board div so that I may target both individual cards
  as well as the whole game board itself.

* Once the basic structure was layout in HTMl, I was able to use CSS to style and manipulate my how the display looked using GRID.

* From there I used JavaScript to access each card and the game board. 

* Creating a empty array to push my selected card in was critical to development. I was able to do this using the method forEach on each card before pushing
 it to the empty array. Next I was then able to take that array and using the Fisher-Yates method I was able to shuffle array/cards.

* From there I wanted to creat a set of check condtions for the game to work:
  * Click on a black square to reveal the card.
  * Click on a second black square to reveal the card.
  * If the two cards match, the cards stay revealed.
  * If there is no match, the cards are hidden and you can click another pair.
  * If a correct pair is identified then a point should be added to the players score.

#
<br><br>
<br><br>
   * When you have correctly matched all 8 pairs of cards, the game ends and an alert window opens congratulating you.
   * Finally I used CSS and some animation to style the background and cards themselves. 
   * Once complete I posted my project on Github.

### Unsolved problems and Major issues:
#

1. One of the serveral difficult stages to over come was finding a way to get my cards to flip and display images.
1. Another major challenge was creating a shuffle function that worked and stored the correct data then render that to my cards. 
1. Flipping all the cards to show current value prior to start.
1. Adding a api to select images.
1. Fixing small glitches suchs as selecting same card once card has been selected.
<br><br>
#

#
### Future Modifications and Ideas:
#

1. Implementing an API to pull various different images and other information.
1. Creat a setting which allows players to chose amount of images/cards to be displayed. Ex: 4, 8, 16, 32, etc...
1. Attach sound to each action that is taken while game is in play. Such as when player clicks square they hear a dog bark.
